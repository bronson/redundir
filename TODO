- show a running count in the top right corner: % redundant, total files, files in trash, files remaining to ttrash
- display keystroke hints on the bottom line of the screen
- it feels weird trying to drive all files to 0%. Maybe this should be about 'necessary' instead of 'redundant'. A 66% redundant file is 33% necessary. That way we trash files unless they're 100% necessary.  (instead of now, trashing files when they're more than 0% redundant)
- there should be a way to cache the hashes to significantly speed up the app

- 'o' to xdg-open a file?
- 'v' to view the file as if it's text (in a pager, is it possible to make binary files less abuvsive)?
